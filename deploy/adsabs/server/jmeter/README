To run the tests, jmeter must be on PATH, you can pass various parameters
to the command line (open the *.xlt) file and look at the top Test Plan

Normally, tests need a list of queries, these can be stored in a file and 
passed as a parameter. Test results are also saved into a separate folder
YOU MUST create this folder yourself.

A typical session may look like:

$ rm -fr test
$ mkdir test
$ jmeter -n -t SolrQueryTest.jmx -DbaseDir=test -DdurationInSecs=5 -DrampUpInSecs=0 -DqueryFile=classic
Created the tree successfully using SolrQueryTest.jmx
