ABOUT MONTYSOLR
===============

MontySolr is the search engine behind Astrophysics Data System (ADS 2.0) - 
"the world's most complete collection of scholarly content in the physical sciences" - 
http://ads.harvard.edu/. It is built on top of SOLR (http://lucene.apache.org/solr) 
but it is not a fork. New features are added as extensions. You can use MontySolr's 
infrastructure to add new functionality or test patches without duplicating code.

So what is here:

  - extremely powerful query parser (equivalent of which you won't find anywhere else)
  - second order queries (operators): analytical query operations
  - batch processing for long-running tasks
  - bitset queries (to search/analyze millions of docs by sending their IDs)
  - author name disambiguation
  - extensive tokenization rules
  - multi-synonym parsing and expansion
  - support for Jython
  - and of course: the whole configuration of the ADS search engine
  
  
In the past MontySolr combined Java with extensions written in C++/Python but now 
that Jython support for JNI arrived, MontySolr switched to pure Java (April 2014)
