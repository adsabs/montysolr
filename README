ABOUT MONTYSOLR
---------------

MontySolr is an open-source distribution of Solr (http://lucene.apache.org/solr)

It is the search engine behind Astrophysics Data System (ADS 2.0) - "the world's most complete collection of 
scholarly content in the physical sciences" - http://labs.adsabs.harvard.edu/adsabs/page/help/ADSinfo

It features:

  - very powerful query parser (equivalent of which you won't find anywhere else)
  - second order queries (operators): extensive citation search
  - batch processing for long-running tasks
  - bitset queries (to search/analyze millions of docs by sending their IDs)
  - author name disambiguation
  - and much more which I'm lazy to type...
  
  
In the past MontySolr combined Java with extensions written in C++/Python but now 
that Jython support for JNI arrived, MontySolr switched to pure Java (April 2014)
