Q: MontySolr (Python) fails with ImportError: module x is not available. But I am sure it is available.

Most likely, the sys.paths are not pointing to the correct folders (ie. when you run Python interpreter
inside Java - when you run Python interpreter directly, the interpreter can deduce path of the site-packages
from its location). Fortunately, the solution is simple, just make sure PYTHONHOME points to the proper
path before you start Java

ie. if you Python executable is in /var/lib/hudson-local/hudson/jobs/001-python/workspace/python/bin/python
do:

export PYTHONHOME=/var/lib/hudson-local/hudson/jobs/001-python/workspace/python

And Python will magically populate sys.path with the dist-packages, site-packages etc.
